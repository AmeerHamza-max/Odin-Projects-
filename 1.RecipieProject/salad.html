    <p>Russian Salad, also known as Olivier Salad, is a creamy, colorful cold salad made with a mix of boiled vegetables, fruits, and sometimes chicken or eggs, all bound together in a rich mayonnaise-based dressing.

It originated in the mid-19th century in Moscow by Belgian chef Lucien Olivier and became popular across Europe and Asia. The salad is known for its balance of flavors — the savory taste of potatoes, carrots, and peas blends with the sweet juiciness of pineapple or apple, while the creamy dressing adds smoothness.

In Pakistan and India, the Russian Salad is often served at weddings, parties, or as a side dish with barbecue and grilled items. It’s loved for its refreshing, slightly tangy, and mildly sweet taste and its attractive, colorful appearance</p>
